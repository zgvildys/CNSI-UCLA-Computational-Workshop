# CNSI-UCLA-Computational-Workshop
Designing a workshop for high school teachers to teach their students on using computers in chemistry and physics through simulation.

We start by explaining the fundamental forces and interactions between atoms and macromolecules, and how we incorporate them in simulation software. We then discuss how temperature affects interactions between particles and gives rise to brownian motion. Then we describe in detail how nanosized objects put themselves together through the process of self-assembly, and how the shapes of the building blocks affect the self-assembly process. Finally, we discuss and demonstrate how viruses put themselves together through self-assembly.

Our work is done through the opensource software Molecular Workbench. The software uses java and a text editor-like interface to create various simulation boxes.

The authors of the workshop are Zachary Gvildys, David Reily, Patricia Poths and Andy Vong.
